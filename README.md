# Hi, I'm Fernando!

A scientist by training, I have a strong background in data pipelines, mathematical modeling, computer programming, distributed computing, and creative problem solving. I am self-driven, passionate about learning, and always eager to apply my skills to new and interesting problems.


## Projects

Below are a few links to interesting projects I've worked/collaborated on:

- [`NEATnik`](https://github.com/fernandozhs/neatnik): Breed and evolve neural networks to solve reinforcement learning problems.
- [`prizm-data-wrangling`](https://github.com/PRIZM-Experiment/prizm-data-wrangling): A Python module which leverages SQLite to keep track of the [PRIZM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09531) experiment's data and deployment configurations.
- [`quantum-particle-production`](https://github.com/fernandozhs/quantum-particle-production): Ever wondered how quantum particle production can affect the Universe's expansion? Find out more about it here.
